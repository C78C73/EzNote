# EzNote

This application is a Windows form note saver. In this application, we can create a new note, save a note, and delete a note. Within this application, it saves those notes locally as our storage, so that you can find them later and edit them. This is just a one stop shop for putting our notes in and as a simple application for storing certain things whether it be a recipe or a title of a book or anything that you write down it can now be saved in one place instead of having it on paper or something that can get lost easily.
